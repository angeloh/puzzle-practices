Please use StackTest class to test the stack and the linked list of min values.
There are one Stack class and one LinkedList class in the package "LinkedListTest".
In the StackTest, I did two times of inputing some values to the stack, and also 
record the history of min values into the linked list. If any proble, feel free
to email me. I look forward to hear from you.
