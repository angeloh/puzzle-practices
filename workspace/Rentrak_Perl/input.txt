
RENTRAK CORPORATION is an information management company serving clients in the entertainment, media, retail, and advertising industries. 

Rentrak Corporation is looking to add more fantastic developers to our team. You're probably used to being the smartest developer on your team (but are too humble to admit it), and are looking for a place where you can work alongside talented peers building great software on interesting projects. We're a small enough company that you can make a big difference here, but we're big enough that your paycheck never bounces. 

Here are some things Rentrak programmers have done recently: 

·	Wrote customized extensions to Open Source tools, to process queries hundreds of times faster than commercial RDBMSs 
·	Built a goal-seeking system to dynamically generate optimal SQL queries for end-user data requests 
·	Celebrated our 20 billionth transaction processed 
·	Implemented software to categorize and predict consumer behavior based on television viewing history 
·	Competed for fame and fortune at a Rentrak sponsored programming contest 
·	Created systems that predict movie sales in theaters, retail stores, and video rental locations 
·	Celebrated a coworker's birthday with a group skydive 
·	Gave a Tech Talk to Google about our brilliant database technology ( http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-4681632964554085715 ) 
·	Rented a room at a local brewery, and played games all night with project teammates 

Our teams are relatively small (3-6 people), and we have a development environment influenced by XP (http://extremeprogramming.org/). 

We have a nice open work area so the developers can share their brilliant ideas, learn from each other about and extend our extensive custom libraries, and work together to solve tough problems. We keep our source code base well factored, and filled with unit tests. 

We work with a stunningly large amount of data, and everyone here does an amazing job of turning it into something manageable. We have a very high hiring bar, and we feel that all the people who work here could easily get a job at any of the major tech companies. Our management understands this, and works hard to make sure our developers are happy and productive. 

We're looking for more developers, especially ones with functional or dynamic object-oriented development experience (e.g., Lisp, Smalltalk, Scheme, Ocaml, SML, Haskell, Ruby, Unlambda, C++/STL/Boost, or advanced use of Python or Perl). RDBMS experience is also helpful, especially with terabyte-plus databases. 

Rentrak Corporation is an international technology leader in the movie industry with headquarters in beautiful Portland, Oregon, near scenic mountains, beaches, and rivers. All of our developers work in-house. Our office has convenient access to public transportation and the freeway. We offer a friendly team oriented workplace, a competitive vacation package, medical/dental and life insurance, educational assistance, 401(k) plan, and a variety of extras.
